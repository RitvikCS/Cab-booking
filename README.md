# TaxiDriver
a taxi booking app in java made along with 3 friends. (College coding assignment)


Please Populate the database file (data.db) first before using the application.


SQLite preferred.


This app was originally created using NetBeans IDE!


Multiple instances of this app can be opened while one instance is already running. This helps emulate multiple users booking a cab in realtime. Connection to Database fails sometimes, it is a good idea to erase the temporary data and re-populate using correct data.

Enjoy :)
